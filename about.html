                Voyager Science started up back in 2019 under Cave Johnson Jr. We got our name from our first invention,
                the Voyager ship.
                Since then, we have experimented on a handful of subjects and developed many gadgets. Our latest and
                most successful gadget
                being the Portal Gun! Our Portal Gun allows the consumer to (in simple terms) teleport! This device was
                made with the latest
                technology we could afford. Due to this, the Portal Gun comes with minor limitations which you can read
                all about AFTER you
                give us your money.

            </p>

            <p>
                The lovely graphs above show just how popular the Portal Gun actually is. With a whole 19 Portal Guns
                sold in the year 2019,
                our company has never been more successful. Now, it appears that there have been some reported
                casualities that we are
                obligated to tell you about. But we can assure you that any deaths caused by a Portal Gun is the users
                fault and not ours.
